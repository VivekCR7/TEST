## 1. what is service oriented architecture?

* Service Oriented Architecture is an architecutral approach in which applications make use of services available in the network.
* It is as well applied in the field of software design where services are provided to the other components, through a communication protocol over a network.
* SOA allows users to combine a large number of facilities from existing services to form applications.
* Each service is an SOA embodies the code and data integration required to execute a complete, discrete business function (e.g., checking a customer's credit, calculating the monthly loan).
* **There are 2 major role within SOA:**
  * **Service provider:**
    * The service provider is the maintainer of the service and the organization that makes one or more services to use.
    * To advertise services, the provider can publish them in a registery, together with a service contract, that specifies how to use it, the requirements of the services, and the fees charged.
  * **Service Consumer:**
    * The service consumer can locate the service metadata in the registery and develop the required client components to bind and use the service.

## Why there is need of SOA ?
<br>

* As the buisnesses grow more complex and the world needs for global systems to meet their goals increased SOA was introduced and was the go-to solution.
* when the monolith solutions started to hit there limit, to make the system organized with seperate modular pieces and abstract those functionalities and make them accessible at specific well-defined endpoints. that's the reason soa is used.
* Distributed systems, the main reason for SOA adoption, cause it allows the software components reusable via service interfaces. These interfaces utilize common communication standards in such a way that they can be rapidly incorporated into new applications without having to perform deep integration each time.
* Different owners, this is also main reason for soa adoption as, businesses and software systems grow and more teams take part in software development, SOA presents ideal solutions for such cases.
* Hetroginity, global and large complex systems tend to lack of harmony different platforms and technologies are used to solve different problems in the system, this introduces many challenges. SOA helps back through smooth integration of different parts into one single systems.
